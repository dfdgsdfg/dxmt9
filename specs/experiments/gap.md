# Experiments Gap

Domain-owned implementation and evidence gap tracker. Use the [root gap index](../gap.md) for cross-domain rollup.

## Experiments Layer

⚠️ Partial. The runner, launcher harness, output layout, one verified local
bootstrap entry, and the full initial real-application catalogue from
R-WILD-3.1 exist. The layer remains partial because the current implementation
depends on the Wine builtin path rather than the native macOS injection path
described by R-WILD-1.2.

| Area | Status | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| `experiments/CATALOGUE.toml` + launcher tree scaffolded | ✅ | R-WILD-5.1 |
| Wine launcher injection harness (`run_experiment.py`, launcher scripts, Heroic staging) | ⚠️ | R-WILD-1.2 |
| Internal backbuffer frame dump + SSIM comparison + `result.json` output | ✅ | R-WILD-2.3, R-WILD-4.1 |
| Bootstrap verified entry: `conf-d3d9-wsi-present` on Heroic Wine 11.5 | ✅ | local workflow validation |
| Verified real application entries: `sample-d3d9-basic-hlsl`, `sample-d3d9-tutorial07`, `sample-d3d9-hdr-formats`, `sample-d3d9-dxut-simple`, `sample-d3d9-irrlicht-lights` | ✅ | Heroic Wine 11.5, direct capture, SSIM 1.0000 |
| Exploratory commercial entry: `app-d3d9-anno-1404` | ⚠️ | supported on Heroic `Wine-11.6-DXMT`; plain `Wine-11.6` is research-only due to Wine `d3dx10_43` aborts |
| Initial catalogue from R-WILD-3.1 staged and verified | ✅ | All five required feature groups covered |
| Reference screenshots for initial catalogue entries | ✅ | R-WILD-4.1 |
| Harness script evidence-production contracts (`scripts/tools/`, `scripts/run_apps/`, `scripts/check/`, `scripts/run_suites/`) | ⚠️ | `specs/experiments/harness/requirements.md`, `specs/experiments/harness/spec.md` |
| Harness `R-HARN-*` requirement enforcement | ❌ | Requirements in `specs/experiments/harness/requirements.md` are phrased as predicates but nothing evaluates them; no checker exists. Deliberate scope choice on 2026-07-27 for the docs-only specification round — means these documents can corrode exactly as the harness scripts they describe already have |
| `replay` domain harness (`scripts/tools/run_3dmark05_mini_replay.py`) | ❌ | Does not currently work. Of the five defects `specs/experiments/harness/requirements.md` §2-§6 derive their rationale from, defects 1, 3, 4, and 5 are unfixed; defect 2 (sliced-stream-offset double-count) was fixed in commit `12348666`. The cause of the resulting black replay output is unknown — constants, scissor, cull, depth input, and draw issue were all eliminated as candidates — and `--force-fragment-color`, the diagnostic flag that would bisect the failure between geometry and fragment stages, is itself broken |
| `scripts/tools/summarize_3dmark05_cleanup_candidates.py` citation counting | ❌ | Miscounts brace-expanded citations such as `...-r{1,2,3}-...`, classifying 84 referenced runs (4.5 GB) as unreferenced and eligible for cleanup when they are not |
| `docs/perfomance/` `source:` citation integrity | ❌ | 34 of the 56 log/output paths cited as evidence in `docs/perfomance/` are already missing from disk as of a 2026-07-27 audit; the citations are dangling |
